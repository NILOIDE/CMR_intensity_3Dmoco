# Intensity-based 3D motion correction for cardiac MR images
This is the code repository for our ISBI submission: 
We propose a method to mitigate the effect of inter-slice motion in CMR images for all SA and LA slices simultaneously by optimizing the 3D rotation and translation parameters on sampled intensities along slice intersections. Our approach is formulated as a subject-specific optimization problem and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying anatomy.
